	  <h2>Evolution of web graphics</h2>
	  
	  <p>Site evaluated: <a href="https://serenade-jacobhoward.c9users.io">Serenade</a></p>
	  
	  <h3>Purpose of web graphics</h3>
	  <p>The graphics on the Serenade home page are subtle, but help to make the page more attractive and to communicate key concepts regarding the feel of the nearby coffee shop. The most prominent image is the center call to action, which includes links to various parts of the site navigating its users to where they need to go to learn more about the coffee shop or the menu. The serenade logo is a combination of the word Serenade, but with a slight twist as the S in Serenade is actually replaced with a treble clef. This holds significance in the fact that the action to Serenade someone is to play romantic music which is subtly mentioned while looking at the logo designed by Jacob Howard. </p>
