    	<p id="overview">This course curriculum is an introduction to the design, creation, and maintenance of web pages and websites. With it, you will learn how to critically evaluate website quality; learn how to create and maintain quality web pages; learn about web design standards and why they're important; and learn to create and manipulate images.</p>

    	<h2>Unit 2</h2>
        <p>In this unit I learned about HTML markup. I expanded my repertoire of HTML tags and
applied many of them to this portfolio website. HTML is a semantically-rich markup language, and enables me to
identify elements on the page by their function. For example, the paragraph you are currently reading is marked up as
a paragraph, abbreviated <em>p</em> in HTML.</p>

        <h2>Unit 3</h2>
        <p class="temp">In this unit we learned Cascading style sheets and how to implement it into the box model. Through various lessons we were able to learn how the box model works and how to implement our newly founded CSS skills to start our websites layout. In Css we learned what selector and how to edit HTML to tags to have different classes, Id's and edited their background-colors, font-sizes and families; as well as padding and margin edits.</p>

        <h2>Unit 4</h2>
        <p class="temp">In this Unit we learned how to integrate images into our web site through a variety of file formats: PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc. Through analyzing the differences in these various file formats for images we can determine as students and web designers which is the best for each sitaution. We used this in practice as we updated our "graphics" page with a photo album of three different images, and two buttons we created in a graphic design program of our choice. </p>

        <h2>Unit 5</h2>
        <p class="temp">In this unit we learned Javascript and how to implement various scripts into our code. Learning the basics of javascript consisted of creating scrpt tags embedded in an html page, creating variables, assiging values to variables, creating functions, and calling elements by their ID in javascript.</p>

        <h2>Unit 6</h2>
        <p class="temp">In this unit wer learned about quality control. We worked on accessibility of our pages and how to establish proper usability with new laws being put in place. We conducted a survey with students in video game that was created to test different features on our site and recieved feedback on how we can improve our design and navigation around our portfolio sites.</p>

        <h2>Unit 7</h2>
        <p class="temp">In the unit we learned about hosting our websites and other clients sites. Through research we came to the conclusion as a class that in Motion was the dominant and most popular choice in the modern web world as it has affordable pricing, good reviews, and has reliable hosting.</p>
