    <h2>Method</h2>
     <p>- My portfolio site was the site being tested with a target audience of sophomore year game design kids. The tasks they were assinged with completing consisted of navigating pages and utilizing javascript. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	 <p>- Yes, the subjects were able to complete all of the tasks, some took a bit longer than others and some were easier to find and utilitze compared to others such as utilizing the clock functionality and finding the accessibility page.</p>
	<h2>Discussion</h2>
	 <p>- From this survey I learned that my design could use some work and that I have to work on making my website more easily accessible to end users and also how to make it function properly even without the use of javascript as it could be harder to figure out how to use and utilize.</p>
